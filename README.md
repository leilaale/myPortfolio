Hi There!

This is Leila! Welcome to my Portfolio Repository!

I had done my portfolio first with only HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I then realized that many jobs require React, Angular, or Vue 
experience as a front-end framework. I have never work with any of them in any previous project other the Flask.

I embarked in the Journey of learning React first and to make it a bit easier on myself I decided to
redo my Portfolio using React.

This allowed me to not worry much of the design since I already had it, and focus more on how React works.

PROBLEMS I CAME ABOUT
    - Since I had previously used some Javascript for some functionality in my portfolio. I had to modify this to make the React components
    work the same. So I learned more of Node.js and React.js
    - I learned to be more careful about CSS styling. I had problems with my input in my contact me section due to previously making css styling for the input in my projects sections. I had made input { display: none}, which made all inputs not appear. I had to find a way to modify this. In this process, I practiced debugging until I found the source of the problem. Then I had to research how to prevent it and apply it to my code.


NEW FEATURES (that were nOt in the previous portfolio):
    - I made a contact me section using EmailJS, this allows for people to send me an email directly to my own email. 
    - New colors. I modified the colors I had, decided I could go for another look since I had gotten a bit bored of the previous one
    - I used .env variables to make secure my API keys for EmailJS


Thank you for checking it out! 

Have an awesome day! 

Best Wishes,

Leila
